# codecademy-html-css-project-1
This is my first front-end project from the Codecademy Front-End Engineer career path.

Project: Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts (design spec here: https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-2/dasmotos-arts_redline.jpg)
Focus: HTML structure and basic CSS styling

I’m new to programming and would appreciate feedback on:
- HTML semantics
- CSS structure and clarity
- General best practices
